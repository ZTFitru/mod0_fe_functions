# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am proud of watching an output being displayed in the terminal after playing around with the codes I wrote. 
Instead of giving up or putting it aside for later, I just kept going until something happened. 
It helped me to look at the notes and the websites provided for us to research, taking a break once in a while helped too. 

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
I see functions as something we create to establish a form of guidance for what we will be working on. It helps us save time 
since we just need to create it once, we can alter it if the outcome is not what we want but it just needs to be done once for 
that specific function.
